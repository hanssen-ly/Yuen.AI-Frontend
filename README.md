This recent winter break, I went all in on a passion project called Yuen.AI.

This past summer, I lost my mom. It hit my family and me really hard, and honestly, I struggled to cope. But out of that tough time, I found myself drawn back to my interest in both programming and psychology. That’s what inspired me to build Yuen.AI—an AI therapist that’s always there when you need it, totally free and easy to access.

I understand how isolating it can feel to be alone, and how difficult it is to afford quality therapy. Yuen.AI was created to help address this gap. While it is not a substitute for professional therapy, it offers a free and accessible way to express your thoughts and find immediate support or solutions.

If Yuen.AI helps even one person feel a little less alone, then it has already done what I set out to do.

This was written in TypeScript, and I used the following tools: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Google Gemini AI, Framer Motion, Radix UI, NextAuth.js, React Hook Form, Lucide React, NodeJs, MongoDB, ExpressJS.

Try [Yuen.AI](https://yuen-ai-frontend-ycjh.vercel.app/) yourself!

## Usage

From there, you can explore the Features page to discover everything Yuen.AI offers, visit the About page to learn the story behind Yuen, toggle between Light and Dark modes, or sign up for an account. Once registered, you’ll be taken to the dashboard, where you can continue tracking your mood, log activities, play games designed to ease anxiety, or chat with Yuen. All your past conversations are saved, making it easy to revisit and reflect on your progress over time.
